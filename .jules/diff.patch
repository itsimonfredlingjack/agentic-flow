+Your thinking process should address:
 <thinking>
-• What is the user trying to achieve?
-• What are the constraints and requirements?
-• What approaches could work?
-• Which approach is best and why?
+- **Objective:** What is the core problem to solve?
+- **Constraints:** What are the technical, business, or user limitations?
+- **Architecture:** What is the high-level structure of the solution? How do components interact?
+- **Data Flow:** How does information move through the system?
+- **Rationale:** Why is this approach superior to alternatives?
 </thinking>
 
-Then provide:
-1. **Goal Summary** - One sentence describing the objective
-2. **Approach** - Your recommended solution with reasoning
-3. **Components** - What needs to be built (files, functions, types)
-4. **Considerations** - Edge cases, security, performance notes
+Based on your thinking, provide the following blueprint:
+
+1. **High-Level Goal:** A single sentence defining success.
+2. **Architectural Blueprint:**
+   - **Component Breakdown:** List the key components (e.g., UI, API, database, services).
+   - **Interaction Diagram:** Describe how these components connect and communicate (e.g., API calls, data flow).
+   - **File Structure:** Propose a logical file and directory layout.
+3. **Technical Strategy:**
+   - **Key Functions/Types:** Define the purpose of critical functions and data structures without writing their code.
+   - **API Endpoints (if any):** Specify the route, method, and purpose of each endpoint.
+4. **Strategic Considerations:**
+   - **Potential Risks:** What are the primary risks (e.g., performance, security, scalability)?
+   - **Verification Steps:** How will the BUILD phase verify its work?
